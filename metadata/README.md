# DSpace Metadata Management

Python administration scripts for managing metadata in [DataSpace](https://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/) and the [Open Access Repository](https://oar.princeton.edu/jspui/). 
These ensure that administrators can export metadata into CSV files. This also 
provides the ability to bulk upload metadata for any given collection.
